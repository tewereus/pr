=> problem within npm install telling me to run npm audit fix --force but not working maybe run create-react-app and migrate all files
=> when the user/admin who is already logged in redirects to login from the url(localhost:3000/login) redirect to homepage or do nothing
=> profile image is not added to logged in users(maybe use cloudinary) and use the model(commented) part to validate image
=> on updateUser make it so that it can't change email or make it's own auth
=> configure authMiddleware to work on client side it says "invalid or expired token"
=> slight problem on otp verification, when i sign up users conscutively the previos otp is displayd for first click and then show the new one after another click
=> make getWishlist like getAllUsers/getAllProducts(not all features but limit and skip and maybe sort if needed)
=> on Coupon model the catagory on discount modify this to get productTypes and also make it multiselectable and also has all choice if the coupon applies to all or some from productTypes 
=> the sold property should be add to the Product Image model to count the sales for recommendation purpose
